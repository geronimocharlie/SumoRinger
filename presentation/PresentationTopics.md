In Hagen, Germany, they are using artificial intelligence to optimise traffic light control and reduce the waiting time at an intersection. Simulations suggest it can decrease waiting times at lights by up to 47% compared to a traditional pre-timed signal plan.

They estimated a 25% fuel savings in the case of large trucks moving in one direction (https://gcn.com/articles/2020/03/25/oak-ridge-ai-traffic-fuel-reductions.aspx)

In Sri Lanka they improved traffic by simulating a fixed-time interval traffic light system and optimizing the cycles. This allowed for easy implementation without requiring significant investments. The delay for studied intersections could be decreased by over 30%. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221524934_Optimization_of_Traffic_Signal_Light_Timing_Using_Simulation)

Include a short before/after optimization video of selected intersection if there is a visible improvement
